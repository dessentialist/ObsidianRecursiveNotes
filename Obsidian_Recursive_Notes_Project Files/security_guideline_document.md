## Overview

**Project Goal:**

- Build a Python tool to recursively export Obsidian Markdown notes and linked files (both Markdown and images), preserving links.
- Support both a GUI (via Tkinter) and a CLI interface for file selection, configuration, and automation.

**Key Features:**

- Recursive export to a user-specified depth
- Auto-handling of circular references to prevent infinite loops
- Customizable export directory structure (`export/notes/` for Markdown and `export/notes/images/` for images)
- Filename sanitization for cross-platform compatibility
- Unicode support in filenames and content
- Error handling with informative messages
- File counting in the GUI to estimate export progress

---

## Architecture & Modules

The project is organized into multiple modules:

- **obsidian_recursive_notes.main**: Entry point for CLI; handles argument parsing and initiates the export process.
- **obsidian_recursive_notes.path_utils**: Contains functions for path resolution, filename sanitization, and export directory creation.
- **obsidian_recursive_notes.file_operations**: Implements the core recursive logic to read files, find links, and copy files to the export directory while avoiding circular references.
- **obsidian_recursive_notes.gui_interface**: Implements the Tkinter-based GUI, which handles file selection, recursion depth input, file counting, and statistics display.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup & Environment

- **Repository Initialization:**
  - Create a new Git repository and structure directories for source code, tests, and documentation.
  - Set up a virtual environment using `venv` or a tool like `pipenv`.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Python 3.6+
  - Standard libraries: `os`, `re`, `shutil`, `pathlib`, `tkinter`
  - Testing: `pytest`, `pytest-cov`
  - Packaging: `setuptools`

### 2. Define the Project Structure

```

### 3. CLI Implementation (obsidian_recursive_notes.main)

- **Argument Parsing:**
  - Use Python's `argparse` module to parse the file path and optional recursion depth.
  - Validate inputs: convert paths to absolute paths and check for file existence.
  - Follow the principle of input validation to prevent processing of unintended files.

- **Execution Flow:**
  - After validation, call the recursive file processor in `file_operations.py`.
  - Provide helpful error messages with generic responses to avoid exposing internal details.

### 4. File & Path Utilities (obsidian_recursive_notes.path_utils)

- **Path Resolution & Sanitization:**
  - Create functions to resolve relative paths, sanitize filenames (to ensure cross-platform compatibility), and build an output directory structure.
  - Ensure sensitive paths are validated to avoid directory traversal issues.

- **Directory Creation:**
  - Implement a routine that checks if the export directories (`export/notes/` for Markdown and `export/notes/images/` for images) exist or need to be created, using secure defaults.

### 5. Recursive File Processing (obsidian_recursive_notes.file_operations)

- **Read Files Recursive:**
  - Create a function `read_files_recursive` to read a Markdown file's content.
  - Process file content and extract Markdown and image links using robust regex patterns.

- **Finding Markdown & Image Links:**
  - Implement `find_markdown_links` and `find_image_links` that parse links and perform sanity checks to ensure they point to valid files.
  - Enforce input sanitization and validate that link targets are within allowed directories.

- **Copying Files:**
  - Develop `copy_file_to_export` to copy valid files to the export directory.
  - Use circular reference checks to avoid reprocessing files already copied.
  - Ensure user-specified recursion depth is adhered to in the recursion logic.

### 6. GUI Implementation (obsidian_recursive_notes.gui_interface)

- **Tkinter GUI:**
  - Build a user interface that allows selection of Markdown files using a file dialog.
  - Create input fields for recursion depth and display file count estimates using `count_expected_links`.
  - Add buttons for initiating the export process and displaying results.
  - Make sure the GUI gracefully handles errors (e.g., missing files) without exposing stack traces.

### 7. Error Handling & Logging

- **Error & Exception Management:**
  - Implement try/except blocks throughout the code, ensuring that exceptions are logged securely (avoid exposing internal file paths or sensitive details).
  - Use Python’s logging module with appropriate security precautions (levels, without sensitive data) to record events.

### 8. Security Hardening

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
  - Rigorously validate all inputs (file paths, recursion depth, user inputs in the GUI) to prevent injection attacks or unintended processing.

- **File Operations:**
  - Validate file types, particularly for images and Markdown files, ensuring no unintended file copying occurs.
  - Ensure permissions are set correctly for created directories.

- **Fail-Safe Defaults:**
  - Secure defaults: Do not reveal detailed error messages to end-users; log them securely elsewhere.
  - Always validate paths to avoid directory traversal attacks.

- **Session & API Considerations:**
  - Although not a web service, maintain principles of least privilege in file system operations.

### 9. Integration & Finalization

- **Integrate GUI and CLI:**
  - Ensure both methods hook into the same backend file processing routines to avoid duplicate logic.
  - Maintain a unified logging and error-handling scheme.

- **Documentation & Comments:**
  - Include comprehensive comments and documentation for contributors and security auditors.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
  - Enforce strict input validation for file paths and recursion depth. Use regex patterns and whitelists where applicable.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error handling that does not leak sensitive information (e.g., file paths, internal exceptions) to the user.

- **File Permissions:**
  - Use secure file permissions when creating or writing to files and directories.

- **Logging:**
  - Use logging judiciously in a way that records necessary information for debugging without exposing private data.

- **Modularity & Least Privilege:**
  - Each module should have only the privileges it needs. The file operations module, for instance, must only operate within defined directories.

---

## Testing and Packaging

- **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests using `pytest` to cover input validation, file operations, and GUI logic.
  - Include tests for edge cases like circular references and invalid file paths.
  - Use `pytest-cov` to ensure high coverage and identify potential weak points.

- **Packaging:**
  - Create a `setup.py` file for packaging with `setuptools`.
  - Ensure the package metadata (version, dependencies, etc.) is complete and does not expose sensitive details.

---

## Conclusion

- This guide provides a complete step-by-step path to implement the Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter with an emphasis on security best practices.
- Security by design is maintained throughout with input validation, error handling, and the principle of least privilege.
- Follow the outlined steps and integrate each component according to the module divisions to build a resilient, maintainable, and secure application.

For further details or modifications, consider reviewing security guidelines and adapting them throughout the coding and deployment lifecycle.
