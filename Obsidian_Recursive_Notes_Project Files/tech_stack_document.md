# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind the Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter in everyday language. Each section highlights why and how the selected technologies support the project’s features and overall functionality.

## Frontend Technologies

Although the primary purpose of the tool is to export notes, it offers interfaces that make the process accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise:

- **Tkinter**
  - Used for building the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
  - Provides a simple and familiar platform for users to interact with the application by selecting files, setting the recursion depth, and viewing results.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
  - This interface allows advanced users to run the tool via terminal commands.
  - Offers flexibility and automation for users comfortable with text-based interactions.

These frontend components ensure that both beginners and power users can easily use the exporter.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of the Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter handles all the file processing and data management tasks. It is built mainly using Python and leverages a variety of standard libraries:

- **Python 3.6+**
  - The foundation of the tool, providing a robust programming environment for developing both the GUI and CLI components.
- **Standard Python Libraries**:
  - **os**: For interacting with the operating system, handling file system operations, and managing directories.
  - **re**: For using regular expressions to identify Markdown and image links within files.
  - **shutil**: For copying files and directories reliably during the export process.
  - **pathlib**: To handle file paths, ensuring consistency and ease of path manipulation across different operating systems.
- **setuptools**
  - Used for packaging and distributing the tool, making it easier to install and use on different systems.
- **Testing Tools**:
  - **pytest** and **pytest-cov**: Employed to test the tool’s functionality and measure code coverage, ensuring that the application works as expected.

These backend choices work together to provide a reliable file processing engine that preserves note linkages and maintains a clean export directory structure.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Although the tool is designed to run from a local machine, the following infrastructure choices help ensure its ease of use and future scalability:

- **Local Execution**
  - The exporter operates directly from the user’s computer without needing a server or cloud infrastructure.
- **Packaging and Distribution**
  - **setuptools** aids in creating an installable package, allowing users to install and update the tool conveniently.
- **Version Control**
  - The project is managed in a code repository (for example, Git) to track changes and collaborate on improvements.
- **Continuous Testing**
  - **pytest** integrates into CI/CD pipelines if deployed through online platforms like Replit or similar IDEs to ensure ongoing code stability and quality.

These decisions make the deployment process straightforward, reliable, and maintainable while enabling collaborative development and quick updates.

## Third-Party Integrations

While the project primarily uses standard Python libraries and tools that come with Python, it does make use of established third-party services for packaging and testing:

- **setuptools**
  - Helps in packaging the project for distribution, ensuring that users can install the tool easily.
- **pytest and pytest-cov**
  - These integrations support thorough testing of the tool’s functionality and reliability.

No external APIs or web services are integrated, so the project remains a standalone, self-contained tool.

## Security and Performance Considerations

A number of measures have been taken to ensure the tool is secure and performs well:

- **Security**
  - **Filename Sanitization**: Filenames are sanitized to remove illegal characters, protecting against issues on different platforms and ensuring safe file handling.
  - **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is implemented to catch and manage exceptions, such as missing files or circular references, while providing informative messages to users.
- **Performance**
  - **Controlled Recursion**: The ability to set a recursion depth helps prevent excessive processing and potential infinite loops, which improves performance and resource usage.
  - **Efficient File Operations**: Using optimized libraries (os, shutil, pathlib) ensures that file handling is efficient, even when dealing with large sets of linked files.

These measures combine to deliver a tool that is both safe to use and efficient, preventing unexpected behaviors and ensuring smooth operation.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter has been built with a thoughtful selection of technologies that address both the ease of use for the end user and the underlying functionality:

- **Frontend**:
  - GUI built with Tkinter provides an easy-to-use interface.
  - Command-Line Interface offers flexibility and automation for advanced users.

- **Backend**:
  - Built on Python 3.6+ and standard libraries such as os, re, shutil, and pathlib to handle file operations effectively.
  - Uses setuptools for safe packaging and distribution.
  - Testing frameworks like pytest ensure that the application remains robust and reliable.

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Designed to run locally with simple packaging and version control, making deployment smooth and updates straightforward.

- **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - Integrations focus on enhanced packaging and testing without reliance on external APIs, keeping the tool self-contained.

- **Security & Performance**:
  - Comprehensive error handling and filename sanitization secure the application across platforms.
  - Controlled recursion and efficient file operations boost overall performance.

Overall, these technology choices ensure that the Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter is a dependable, user-friendly tool that meets its goal of efficiently exporting linked Markdown files and images while preserving their relationships. This careful balance between frontend simplicity and backend robustness sets it apart as a reliable solution for managing and exporting Obsidian notes.
