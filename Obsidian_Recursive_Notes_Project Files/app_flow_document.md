# Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

This application is a standalone file exporter that does not require traditional account creation or sign-in actions. A new user starts by downloading or cloning the repository from the project’s source. Once the user has the files locally, they can either launch the graphical user interface by running one of the provided scripts (like run.py, run.sh, or run_gui.bat) or use the command-line interface by executing the main script directly with the necessary arguments. There is no need for sign-in or user registration because the tool is built for local use and does not maintain user session data. For users who encounter problems, such as forgetting a setting or misconfiguring a parameter, the error messages within the app provide guidance to correct the mistake, thus acting as the recovery mechanism in place of a formal password recovery process.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

When a user launches the graphical interface, they are greeted with a simple and clear dashboard that allows them to select a Markdown file using an easy-to-use file dialog. The screen includes straightforward options such as choosing the file to export, specifying the recursion depth for processing linked files, and initiating the export process. The command-line interface, on the other hand, displays usage instructions in the terminal window when the script is run without parameters or when help is requested. In both cases, there is a clear flow where the user provides the necessary input; in the GUI this is through interactive file picking and input fields, while in the CLI it is via command-line arguments. The application ensures the user understands the available options before moving forward with the export process.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once the user has selected their file and set the recursion depth using the GUI, the application immediately begins by parsing the input. The GUI retrieves the file path and depth, ensuring the path is valid and converting it into an absolute path. Simultaneously, an export directory is automatically prepared either on the desktop or at another default location. If the user is operating through the CLI, the entered arguments are parsed where the tool validates that the file exists and the correct recursion depth parameter is provided. The next major step in both interfaces is the file counting phase. In the GUI, the system employs a function to estimate the number of files that will be processed, giving the user an idea of the scope of the export and any warnings if expected counts differ from reality.

After the preliminary checks, the core functionality engages in a recursive file processing routine. Here, the tool opens the selected Markdown file and uses built-in functions to read its content. It then searches for links to other Markdown files and images using regular expressions. For each link discovered, the tool calls a dedicated function to copy the linked file into the pre-created export directory while also ensuring that the recursion depth is maintained and circular references are safely handled. This seamless chain of actions enables the application to transition from reading a single file to constructing an organized output structure. Once the recursive traversal and processing are completed, the export process finalizes by summarizing the actions, copying files into a well-defined folder tree with a dedicated location for notes and subfolders for images. The GUI then displays a completion message with summary statistics, while the CLI outputs a similar completion message to the terminal, ensuring that the user is well informed of the results of their export action.

## Settings and Account Management

In this application there is no traditional account management since no user accounts are required. However, the tool does allow users to adjust settings related to the export process. For instance, within the GUI, users can input or select options such as the maximum recursion depth and optionally choose an alternative export directory if the default location is not desired. These settings are simply part of the initial configuration screen and can be modified before starting the export operation. After making the necessary adjustments, the user can return to the main dashboard to initiate the export. The command-line version similarly accepts parameter inputs where users can define the recursion depth and file path. Once the export is completed, the system resets back to a state ready to accept new input, maintaining the flow without any disruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the export journey, the application is designed to handle errors gracefully. If a user selects a file that does not exist or tries to process a file with an unsupported format, the tool provides a clear error message, explaining the issue in simple language and suggesting corrective actions. If issues such as missing files or invalid recursion depth values are encountered, the tool alerts the user immediately and stops the process to prevent further errors. In cases where connectivity issues or file system permissions cause a snag, fallback procedures ensure that the user is informed with details on what went wrong and how to fix it. Specifically, the system’s deep incorporation of error handling helps users recover quickly and return to the main flow by reattempting file selection or modifying their input parameters.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The Obsidian Recursive Notes Exporter offers a direct and intuitive journey for users seeking to export Obsidian notes along with all file links intact. The journey begins with a simple download and launch process, where the user either selects their file through an easy-to-navigate GUI or enters the required path and options via a command-line interface. Once the file is chosen, the tool validates the input, estimates the number of files to handle if applicable, and then embarks on a recursive file processing adventure that adheres to the user-defined recursion depth. Each step is built with robust error handling to ensure that the process is clear and manageable even for non-technical users. Finally, after all linked files are copied into a clean export structure, a completion message confirms the success of the operation. This well-connected flow, from the initial launch to final export, makes the tool accessible, reliable, and practical for everyday use.
